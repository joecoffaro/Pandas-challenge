# Pandas-challenge
1. Create a new repository for this project called pandas-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for this homework assignment and name it PyCitySchools.

4. Add your Jupyter notebook to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis.

5. Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.


The objective of the analysis below was to help a school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

I was tasked with creating a District Summary and a School Summary. In addition I needed to find the Highest-Performing Schools and Lowest-Performing Schools. 

After doing so I needed to calculate Math scores by grade, reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size and type. 

Calculations for District summary:

Total number of unique schools
Total students
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Calculations for School Summary:
School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


Once finding those numbers I needed to construct both into DataFrames. 
 
  after constructing the calculations into DataFrames, I was able to read into the data more clear and draw conclusions. 

2 conclusions from the analysis:

    - Scores by School Type: district schools preformed lower than charter schools in both math and reading
  
    - Scores by School Spending: more school spending does not result in higher test scores compared to schools that spend less
